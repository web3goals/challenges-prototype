1. Community starts challenge by choosing a template with rules for participation and defining prize pool, deadline.
2. After that, shares the link to the challenge with other members of the community.
3. Members join the challenge. Also share it with their friends if the challenge rules motivate them to do so.
4. Participants fulfill all conditions and mark the challenge as completed, which will be verified by smart contracts and oracles.
