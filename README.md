## ⚡ About

Web3 Challenges is an application that helps communities and DAOs increase the engagement of existing members and attract new ones through challenges that are controlled and verified by smart contracts.

## 🪄 How it works

1. Community leader creates a challenge, sets a prize pool and deadline.
   - _For example, a community of developers can create a challenge #30DaysOfCode._
2. Community leader shares the link to the challenge with other community members.
3. Members join the challenge.
   - _If this is a challenge #30DaysOfCode, then each participant must define their own twitter handle._
4. Before the deadline, each participant must verify his result.
   - _For the challenge #30DaysOfCode verification will be done with oracle, which checks user tweets using Twitter API._
5. After the deadline, the community finalizes the challenge. Each participant with verified result will receive a part of the prize pool.
